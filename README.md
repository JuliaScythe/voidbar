# Voidbar
_A DIS OS polybar theme_

## Requirements
- polybar
- i3 (for the workspace switcher)
- Alkhemikal font
- Probably some other things that I forgot

## Usage
1. Clone to `~/.config/polybar/voidbar`
2. Install the `voidstrangericons.ttf` font
3. Run `polybar -q main -c "~/.config/polybar/voidbar/config.ini"` to invoke the bar
