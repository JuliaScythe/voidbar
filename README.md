# Voidbar
_A DIS OS polybar theme_

## Requirements
- polybar
- i3 (for the workspace switcher)
- Alkhemikal font
- Probably some other things that I forgot!

## Usage
1. Clone to `~/.config/polybar/voidbar`
2. Install the `voidstrangericons.ttf` font
3. Run `polybar -q main -c "~/.config/polybar/voidbar/config.ini"` to invoke the bar

You may want to update the programs launched by clicking the icons on the bar to programs of your choice.

## Contact
For any questions, suggestions, or issues, it's best to contact me through the `juliascythe` account on Discord! (I don't check github very often so might not see any issues here.)
